    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      He has a BSc degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil, which included researchers in Pattern Recognition and Computer Graphics. Currently MSc and Doctoral Student in Computer Science at Fluminense Federal University, Brazil. His master’s research was in clustering algorithms, emphasis about spatially constrained clustering. He has experience in Computer Science, focusing on Pattern Recognition, Data Mining, and Machine Learning.  In this scenario, he has published many papers, with many undergraduate degrees in progress. He was a Research Engineer in Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision fields in ISABO enterprise. During this period, his research focused on people fall detection issues under RGB images and object segmentation of RGBD images. He is currently working on research involving the Ambient Intelligence, principally in Context Reasonings for Human Activity Recognition on Context-Aware computing.
