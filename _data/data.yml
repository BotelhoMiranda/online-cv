    summary: |
      He has a BSc degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Alagoas, Brazil, which included researchers in Pattern Recognition and Computer Graphics. Currently MSc and Doctoral Student in Computer Science at Fluminense Federal University, Brazil. His master’s research was in clustering algorithms, emphasis about spatially constrained clustering. He has experience in Computer Science, focusing on Pattern Recognition, Data Mining, and Machine Learning.  In this scenario, he has published many papers, with many undergraduate degrees in progress. He was a Research Engineer in Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision fields in ISABO enterprise. During this period, his research focused on people fall detection issues under RGB images and object segmentation of RGBD images. He is currently working on research involving the Ambient Intelligence, principally in Context Reasonings for Human Activity Recognition on Context-Aware computing.

Espacial (Clusters Analysis with Spatially Contiguity
Constraints).

        Regionalization embraces many problems in which the recognition and analysis of patterns in geographic regions is necessary. Clustering techniques and some optimization methods offer algorithms and tools to facilitate this task, and AZP (Automatic Zoning Problem) is one of these optimization methods. In this work, we use semi-supervised clustering by adapting K-Means for regionalization, which was not previously explored. For this purpose, we specified contiguity constraints based on a neighborhood representation. The proposed algorithm is called RegK-Means. Experimental results using three real datasets show improvement in intra-cluster variance, minimization of objective function and computational time improvement compared to AZP.
